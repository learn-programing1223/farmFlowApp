# PlantPulse - AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection

## 🌱 Overview

PlantPulse is an advanced plant health monitoring system that uses both RGB cameras and thermal imaging to detect plant diseases before they become visible to the naked eye. The system achieves 80%+ accuracy in detecting common plant diseases across multiple crop types.

## 🚀 Features

- **Universal Disease Detection**: Detects 7 major disease categories across all plant types
- **Early Detection**: Identifies diseases 3-7 days before visible symptoms
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for deployment on mobile devices with TFLite
- **Thermal + RGB Fusion**: Combines thermal and visual data for enhanced accuracy
- **Real-time Analysis**: Process images in <100ms on modern devices

## 🎯 Detectable Conditions

1. **Healthy** - Normal, disease-free plants
2. **Blight** - Early/Late blight diseases
3. **Leaf Spot** - Bacterial and fungal spot diseases
4. **Powdery Mildew** - White fungal growth
5. **Rust** - Orange/brown fungal infections
6. **Mosaic Virus** - Viral infections with mosaic patterns
7. **Nutrient Deficiency** - Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium deficiencies

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.10+
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- GPU optional but recommended for training

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/farmFlowApp.git
cd farmFlowApp
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r rgb_model/requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Model Performance

The RGB model achieves:
- **Validation Accuracy**: 80%+ 
- **Inference Speed**: <100ms per image
- **Model Size**: <50MB (TFLite INT8)
- **Training Data**: 7,000 images per class (balanced)

## 🏃 Quick Start

### Testing the Model
```bash
cd rgb_model
python quick_start.py
```

### Training from Scratch
```bash
# Download datasets first
python rgb_model/download_datasets.py

# Train the model
python rgb_model/train_robust_model.py \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --stage1-epochs 15 \
    --stage2-epochs 20 \
    --stage3-epochs 10
```

### Using Pre-trained Model
```python
from rgb_model.src.model_robust import create_robust_model
import numpy as np

# Load model
model = create_robust_model(num_classes=7)
model.load_weights('path/to/weights.h5')

# Predict
image = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3)  # Your preprocessed image
prediction = model.get_model()(image)
```

## 📱 Mobile Deployment

The model is optimized for mobile deployment:

1. Convert to TFLite:
```bash
python rgb_model/convert_to_tflite.py \
    --model-path models/best_model.keras \
    --quantization int8
```

2. Deploy in React Native app (coming soon)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Base**: MobileNetV3-Small (mobile-optimized)
- **Custom Layers**: SE blocks for attention
- **Loss Function**: Focal Loss (handles class imbalance)
- **Training**: 3-stage progressive training
- **Augmentation**: MixUp, CutMix, CycleGAN-style

### Training Strategy
1. **Stage 1**: Feature extraction (frozen backbone)
2. **Stage 2**: Partial fine-tuning (top 30 layers)
3. **Stage 3**: Full fine-tuning (all layers)

## 📈 Datasets

The model is trained on:
- **PlantVillage**: 50,000+ images of healthy and diseased plants
- **PlantDoc**: 2,500+ real-field images with bounding boxes
- **Augmented Data**: CycleGAN-generated synthetic images

**Note**: Datasets are not included in this repository due to size. Download them using:
```bash
