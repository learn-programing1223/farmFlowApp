print("""
OLD (Incorrect):
   focal_weight = y_true * (1 - y_pred) ** self.gamma + (1 - y_true) * y_pred ** self.gamma
   
FIXED:
   p_t = tf.reduce_sum(y_true * y_pred, axis=-1, keepdims=True)  # Probability of true class
   focal_weight = tf.pow(1.0 - p_t, self.gamma)  # Correct focal weight
   
Why it matters: The old version was calculating focal weight incorrectly,
preventing the model from focusing on hard examples.
""")

print("\n2. LEARNING RATE FIX:")
print("""
OLD: learning_rate = 0.0005  # Too low
FIXED: learning_rate = 0.001  # Standard initial learning rate

Why it matters: Learning rate was too low, causing extremely slow convergence.
""")

print("\n3. LOSS FUNCTION SETUP:")
print("""
OLD: Using softmax in final layer + loss without from_logits
FIXED: No activation in final layer + from_logits=True in loss

Why it matters: Prevents numerical instability and ensures proper gradient flow.
""")

print("\n4. ARCHITECTURE FIX:")
print("""
OLD: GlobalMaxPooling2D()  # Loses spatial information
FIXED: GlobalAveragePooling2D()  # Better for feature aggregation

Why it matters: GAP is more stable for classification tasks.

FIXED Configuration:
- Adam optimizer with lr=0.001
- Focal Loss with alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0
- Proper metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC

With these fixes, you should see:
1. Loss decreasing from epoch 1 (not stuck at 0.75-0.76)
2. Accuracy improving beyond random chance (16.7% for 7 classes)
3. Precision/Recall showing non-zero values
4. Model converging within 5-10 epochs on simple data

BEFORE (Your reported results):
- Accuracy stuck at ~16.7% (random chance)
- Loss barely changing (0.75-0.76)
- Precision/Recall at 0.0
- No learning after 2+ hours

AFTER (Expected with fixes):
- Accuracy should reach 30-40% in first few epochs
- Loss should decrease steadily
- Precision/Recall should show improvement
- Visible learning within minutes

print("HOW TO USE THE FIXED MODEL:")
print("-"*40)

print("""
1. Update your training script to use model_fixed.py:
   
   from model_fixed import build_fixed_model, compile_fixed_model
   
   # Build model
   model, base_model = build_fixed_model(num_classes=7)
   
   # Compile with fixed settings
   model = compile_fixed_model(model, learning_rate=0.001, use_focal_loss=True)
   
   # Train as normal
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, ...)

2. Or run the updated training script:
   python train_with_fixed_model.py --samples-per-class 2000 --batch-size 8

3. Monitor these metrics:
   - Loss should decrease immediately (not stay flat)
   - Accuracy should improve beyond 16.7% quickly
   - Training should show progress within first epoch
